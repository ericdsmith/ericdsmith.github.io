title: Async Notes
---
-Any time you wrap a portion of code into a function and specify that it should be executed in response to some event (timer, mouse click, Ajax response, etc.), you are creating a later chunk of your code, and thus introducing asynchrony to your program.

-The JS engine doesn't run in isolation. It runs inside a hosting environment, which is for most developers the typical web browser. Over the last several years (but by no means exclusively), JS has expanded beyond the browser into other environments, such as servers, via things like Node.js. In fact, JavaScript gets embedded into all kinds of devices these days, from robots to lightbulbs.

-In other words, the JS engine has had no innate sense of time, but has instead been an on-demand execution environment for any arbitrary snippet of JS. It's the surrounding environment that has always scheduled "events" (JS code executions).

-So, for example, when your JS program makes an Ajax request to fetch some data from a server, you set up the "response" code in a function (commonly called a "callback"), and the JS engine tells the hosting environment, "Hey, I'm going to suspend execution for now, but whenever you finish with that network request, and you have some data, please call this function back."

(_**Refer to the HR lecture on async**_) As you can see, there's a continuously running loop represented by the while loop, and each iteration of this loop is called a "tick." For each tick, if an event is waiting on the queue, it's taken off and executed. These events are your function callbacks.

It's important to note that setTimeout(..) doesn't put your callback on the event loop queue. What it does is set up a timer; when the timer expires, the environment places your callback into the event loop, such that some future tick will pick it up and execute it.

-This is called "run-to-completion" behavior. (_Find a good definition for this term_)

```javascript
var a = 1;
var b = 2;

function foo() {
    a++;
    b = b * a;
    a = b + 3;
}

function bar() {
    b--;
    a = 8 + b;
    b = a * 2;
}

// ajax(..) is some arbitrary Ajax function given by a library
ajax( "http://some.url.1", foo );
ajax( "http://some.url.2", bar );
```
